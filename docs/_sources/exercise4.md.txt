# PBPL280S21 Exercise 4: git collaboration 


1. Fork the relevant repository for your team's project.

2. Using the shell on your jupyterhub account, clone your fork.
   
4. On your clone, create a branch called `first`.

5. Update the `README.md` file to add you github id to the list of contributors. Use a markdown link so your [id](https://github.com/sjsrey) serves as a link to your github account.

6. Using `git push`,  push your local branch up to your fork.

7. From your fork, issue a pull request into the upstream repository.
